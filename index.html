          <p>The lehenga first consists of a crop top which can either be a solid color with little detailing or more elaborate. The main showstopper of this costume is the skirt, which extends from the waist to the floor. Skirts are heavily detailed, with ornate patterns. For weddings, they are often decorated in metallic and gold colors. The final piece of the outfit is the shawl that is wrapped over one shoulder. The shawl can also be intricately embroidered or more simple to complement the skirt.</p>
